The lightweight design combines the benefits of tilt with a high degree of mobility independence.
        
The new lightweight models have aluminum frames which are 30% lighter than the steel frames.Aluminum offers remarkable tensile strength and a strength to weight ratio much higher than steel.

 Independent propelling with the benefits of tilt and recline. Better ACCESS to life.
 The QUICKIE® ACCESS™ solves multiple seating challenges while allowing clients to self-propel, offering much appreciated independence. Its low seat-to-floor height allows access under tables and desks. It also allows the client to foot propel. If the client is using their hands to propel, the ACCESS tilt provides greater accessibility to the wheels while also promoting a stable and functional posture. Up to 25° of tilt and 50° of recline offers clinically effective pressure relief.
 Low Seat-to-Floor Height
 Knee-pivot wheelchairs (with pivots at the knee) have very different characteristics than center-of-gravity-pivot chairs. The forward pivot location provides low knee rise during tilt, enabling easy foot propulsion and clearance under tables for easier social engagement. Even if a thick cushion is needed for pressure relief or if larger casters are preferred, a low seat-to-floor height can be maintained, facilitating a stepping activity to propel the wheelchair. Access to tables is still achievable while managing pressure.
 Seating
 Tilt and Recline
 Adjustable tilt and recline provides alternative positions for pressure management by meeting the recommended angles of 25 degrees of tilt and 50 degrees of recline. This ability to change the position of the wheelchair assists with improving trunk posture – enhancing respiration, digestion, and function of other vital organs.

 Posterior Tilt
 For clients with kyphosis, positioning the ACCESS in a posterior angle will reorient the user with their eyes in line with the horizon. This position also allows gravity to help keep the head and trunk upright and minimize sliding out of the wheelchair.

 Anterior Tilt
 The ACCESS is the only chair with -5° anterior tilt for easy standing and transferring. By positioning the wheelchair frame at an anterior angle, the user will be able to more easily stand up for transfers and pressure management. An anterior angle also provides alternative positioning and can improve functional reach to enhance participation.
 
 Portable
 By folding the backrest down and removing the wheels, the ACCESS can be transported in a standard vehicle for medical appointments or family visits. With a transport weight of 32 lbs., the ACCESS can be easily lifted in and out of vehicles for access outside of the home.
 Transit Approved
 The QUICKIE ACCESS offers transit-approved tie-down brackets for safe occupant vehicle travel. The compact base makes traveling easy for everyone involved.

 Locking Crossbrace and Stabilizer Bar
 The M6 utilizes a double locking crossbrace and stabilizer bar to minimize frame flex and create a more rigid ride quality. This ensures that more energy transfers directly from your arms or feet to the axles for the most efficient propulsion.

    The Broda Encore Pedal Wheelchair (Rocking) (48R V4) combines comfort, functionality, and style in a highly-customizable and infinitely-adjustable package. 
As the name suggests, the entire seat rocks gently back and forth to soothe anxious patients and provide the comforting sensation of movement.
Patients can rock themselves or have caregivers stimulate the movement; similarly, patients can self-propel with their feet or arms via optional front-mounted mag wheels, or allow caregivers to propel them with the rear caregiver handle designed to provide precise control over maneuverability.

    Support and positioning are forefronts in the Encore Pedal Wheelchair. 
The angle of the chair can be adjusted up to 18 degrees thanks to the tilt-in-space feature; this range increases to 33 degrees when combined with the rocking motion.
Adjusting the chair's angle serves to accommodate more ergonomic positioning for sitting and self-propulsion and also reduces pressure on sensitive areas with pressure ulcers or other skin irritations. Broda's signature Comfort Tension Seating utilizes a series of elastic bands that uniquely conform to the patient's contours, enhancing comfort without sacrificing vital support; the long-lasting bands return quickly to their original shape when no longer weight-bearing.

    To personalize this chair to the individual patient, multiple seat widths, depths, and heights from the floor, as well as back heights are available. Height-adjustable armrests with soft padding are also upgradable to different styles to suit your patient's needs. 
The upper lateral support wings can be adjusted to accommodate the patient and are also entirely removable to suit the situational needs.
Lower side pads, shoulder bolsters, seat and back pads, and a neck rest all come standard for optimal comfort and positioning.
To ensure durability and longevity, the frame is made of powder-coated steel and can support up to 350 pounds; both the frame and upholstery are available in multiple color options, allowing for a personalized touch.

    To further customize the Broda Encore Pedal Wheelchair (Rocking) (48R V4) to the patient's needs, a series of accessories are available. Stationary, swing-away, and/or elevating footrests increase the positioning benefits of the chair, while the IV pole and O2 holder ensure the chair is compatible with the medical needs of the patient. 
Front-mounting mag wheels increase the chair's versatility and allow for hand self-propulsion, and the detachable tray provides a stable workspace for everything from eating to coloring.

The Sorrento Therapeutic Chair by Seating Matters lends itself to the users changing needs by being extremely flexible when forming to the desires of the user.
The Sorrentos multivariable adjustments bestow upon the user a fully customizable chair that is also extremely comfortable and durable. A favorite in hospitals and rehabilitation centers, this chair may also be used in the home setting. Its purpose is to improve posture and redistribute the pressure that results in pain. A variety of additional supports and pillows can be used with the chair to better help the user partake in daily activities such as eating, reading, and socializing.

Features Included:

Braking castors: Castors allow for the chair to be smoothly moved to different locations.
The castors feature breaks that enable the chair to be firmly planted in one spot but also help with maintaining trajectory when moving the chair.

Back angle adjustment: The back angle of the chair may be adjusted via a release handle on the back of the chair that should be used by a competent individual.
This allows for individuals to find the most comfortable angle for the back and can be used to adapt the chair for specific activities as well.

Tilt in space: The chair may be tilted forward or backward depending on the situation. This allows individuals to reach the best angle of comfort when resting in the chair, but can also help people stand up when necessary.
Seat depth: Seat depth can be varied to the desires of the user to further provide comfort to the user.

Arm removal: The chair features removable arms that completely come off the chair which comes in handy for when the chair needs to be pushed up to a table or desk.
Seat width adjustment: The width of the seat may be changed in order to fit larger individuals or to contour the chair better to the user.
This is done by bringing the arms rests closer for a tighter fit or pulling them out further if more space is needed. When spread further than the cushion that comes with the chair, a wider cushion can be fitted into the chair.

 Arm height adjustment: Arm height may be moved higher or lower depending on the needs of the user. This can help the chair fit under a table or desk, but won't be suitable for all seating arrangements. Furthermore, the armrests may be brought higher to increase postural support.

 Leg elevation: Leg elevation can be varied by lifting up or pushing down the padded leg rest on the chair. This ability further increases customizability and comfort when residing on the chair.

The Phoenix Therapeutic Chair by Seating Matters is the top of the line support chair on the market that ensures individuals get the support and comfort they need in an everyday relaxer chair.
The support features of the chair ensure proper accommodation for spinal conditions that need maximum support for their condition. 
The chair has a variety of features that help adjust the chair to the needs of the individual in order to best attain the most comfortable position.

  Features Included:

  Breaking castors: Ensure the stability of the chair with brakes that prevent the chair from moving when it's not supposed to.

  Back angle adjustment: Effortlessly recline the back of the chair by closing the release lever while moving the back of the chair to the desired position. Once at the desired position, relax the release lever to prevent the back from moving.

  Tilt in space: Tilt the chair by holding down the push handle while closing the release lever, and then tilting the chair into its required position. Make sure to let go of the release lever.

  Seat depth: Seat depth can be customized by loosening the thumb screws set at 45 degrees under the seat. Adjust the seat and then tighten the screw.

  Arm removal: The arms on the chair can be easily removed if needed. Loosen the screws behind and in front of the arm and carefully pull it out if need be.

  Seat width adjustment: Seat width can also be adjusted by loosening the same screws on the arms and sliding the arms out to the desired width on the chair and then tightening the screws to secure the width position.

  Arm height adjustment: Arm height can be adjusted to best suit the individual by loosening the arm screws and removing the arm and then reinserting the arm into the desired height option on the frame.

  Footplate height: Adjustment of the footplate may be adjusted in height by locating spring plungers on either side of the footplate and sliding them up and down the glide rail. When released the plungers will catch into the nearest hole and enable a change in height of the footplate. 
The footplate may also be completely removed if necessary, via this same method.

  Footplate angle: The angle of the footplate can be moved to three angles by locating three bolts on each side of the footplate, removing the desired bolts, and allowing the footplate to reach its desired angle

The cushions are coated in a non-slip material that helps ensure the individual remains planted in the chair throughout movement.

  Partial/Full motorized hand control: Full or partial motorization is available of the Phoenix and provides the seated individual with the ability to change the parameters of the chair on their own while being seated in the chair, which helps with finding the optimal seating position.

  With the Catalyst 5 you have the ability to adjust your Center of Gravity (CG), a critical design criteria for a K0005 class chair.  
Both axle plate options, standard and curved, are machined from Billet 6061-T6 aluminum and offer finite adjustment of the CG and rear seat height.  3/16″ of CG adjustment over a 3 ½” range is a snap with the innovative 3D locking index washer design.  It only requires one wrench.
The standard axle plate offers 1″ adjustments in rear-seat height and 1° adjustments of wheel camber while the curved axle plate offers a more discrete ½” of fine tuning adjustments in the rear seat.

  Wheelchairs Are About Wheels

    Features

    Rotation-In-Space: Instead of tilting the seat frame from an outside pivot-point the Quickie® IRIS™ actually rotates the seat frame around the users center-of-gravity.
    This rotational system provides the shortest possible wheelbase without compromising stability. It also insures a smooth and controlled rotation.

    The 60° & 40° Tilt Advantage: The Quickie® IRIS™ features three tilt ranges: -5° to 50°, 0° to 55°, and 5° to 60° on the standard 55° seat frame, and -5° to 35°, 0° to 40°, and 5° to 45° on the 40° seat frame. As the seat frame rotates past 45°, a significant amount of pressure transfers from the seat to the back. By providing up to 60° of tilt, the IRIS insures that the majority of pressure is removed from the ischial tuberosities. For individuals who only need positioning relief, the 40° tilt frame is ideal.

    Low Seat-To-Floor Height: The Quickie Iris now features a 12 1/2″ front seat-to-floor height. Using a drop seat, this distance can be lowered to an even lower 10 ½” seat-to-floor height. Low seat-to-floor height is critical for users who use foot propulsion.

    Cable Free: Cables always getting in the way? Not a problem with the Quickie IRIS foot release tilt actuator. It’s easy to operate, clean as a whistle and tangle free. It’s also available at no additional charge.

    The improved Quickie IRIS shed 6 lbs. in overall weight. An 18″ x 18″ IRIS with 70° hangers now weighs a slim 39 lbs.

    Eliminate the need for exposed cables with the Foot Release Tilt Actuator. Never again worry about cable systems getting in the way. It’s easy to operate, clean as a whistle and tangle free.

    This super durable hub lock is now 10 times stronger. Rated at 350 lbs, wheels lock securely into place eliminating the dependence on the rear wheel’s tire pressure for a secure, locked position. Minimal adjustments are needed and cables are conveniently kept out of the way making engagement of the hub lock a snap. The locking mechanism provides multiple mounting positions for quick and easy access.

    Swing-in/Swing-Out Footrests are excellent for confined spaces and are ideal for reduced hand dexterity.

    The Quickie® IRIS™ features a special angle-adjustable stroller handle that quickly adjusts to a variety of caregiver heights, conveniently offered at no charge.

    A patented backpost bracket allows repositioning of the backpost seat-depth without removing the attaching hardware.

    Specialty options, such as a reclining backrest, vent-and-battery tray, and one-arm drive are all available as “on-chair” options.

    A tilt-angle indicator and a set of tilt-stops ship with every chair to provide a precise tilt range and tilt angle-setting.
