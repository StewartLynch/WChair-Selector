     What is the rear wheel of wheelchair called?***
     
     Drive wheels. Manual wheelchairs usually have two sets of wheels: A pair in front, called caster or steering wheels; and a pair in the back called drive wheels.

     What is a wheelchair seating system?***
     
     Seating systems are groups of components that make contact with your body while you're in your custom wheelchair to support you in a sitting position. These individually prescribed components include the cushion, back support and postural supports.

     What are the parts of a wheelchair called?***
     
     The key components are the tires, the wheels, the axles, the casters, the leg rests, and the armrests.
     Tires. Wheelchair tires are either solid rubber or pneumatic (air-filled)
     Wheels: The wheels are usually spoked (wired) or molded (mag)/Axles/Casters/Leg rests/Armrests.

     What is seat dump wheelchair?***
     
     On custom wheelchairs, the seats are sometimes higher in the front, sloping down toward the back. The angle of the seat compared to the ground is known as "seat dump" or "rake." Having some degree of seat dump means that more of your weight presses against the wheelchair back making you feel more stable in your seat.

     What are the brakes on a wheelchair called?***
     
     There are a number of types of brakes that wheelchair users can install on their chair's wheels. They are designed to hold a wheelchair in a safe stationary position. The brakes are usually called wheelchair wheel locks or wheelchair brakes.

     What is a seat slope?***
     
     What's in a name? Seat slope has a range of commonly heard synonyms — seat angle, seat inclination, squeeze, dump — used in different contexts. ... “Seat slope truly is if you have a 17" seat-to-floor height in the front and 15" seat-to-floor height in the back, it's that 2" change in front and rear seat-to-floor height


     When should you put the brakes on the wheelchair?***
     
     Always Use the Wheelchair Brakes When Necessary Nurses and other care providers should use these brakes not just when the patient is sitting in the chair and not planning on going anywhere, but also when they're transferring a patient from the chair to a bed, bath, or vice versa.

            title: "Manual Wheelchair Frames",
            definition: """
     The frame of the wheelchair is the component that holds all the other components together and determines the type of wheelchair that will result from assembly. Standard weight wheelchairs will usually have steel frames, light weight wheelchairs will usually have aluminum frames and ultralight frames can be made of either aluminum or titanium frames.
     
     The frame of the wheelchair has an effect on the propulsion of the wheelchair in a couple of different ways. The lighter the weight, the easier it is to propel so a titanium frame is easier to propel than a steel frame. The more rigid the frame the less it will flex when being propelled so a welded rigid frame without moving parts will be easier to propel than a folding frame that will flex when propelled.
     
     Folding Wheelchair Frames
     
     The pictured frame is a conventional lightweight folding frame and consists of a cross frame and two side frames. Folding frames are by far the most common types of frame available today because of their ability to fold for transportation and storage. Standard, light weight and light weight adjustable wheelchairs are constructed with folding frames. The seat upholstery on a folding frame is attached to the frame making the wheelchair frame also the seat frame
     
     Rigid Wheelchair Frames
     
     The rigid wheelchair frame will look similar to the folding frame but will have straight bars attaching the two side frames together instead of the cross frame and the frame will be all welded together to strengthen joints. The seat upholstery will still attach to the frame and the back posts will be the same. Rigid frames are stronger and lighter than the other wheelchair frames and are used for sports and very active teens and adults
     
     Reclining Wheelchair Frame
     
     Reclining wheelchair frames are usually folding frames similar to the regular folding frames except the back posts will be hinged to allow the backrest of the wheelchair to recline back. The reclining frame can be either steel or aluminum but will still be substantially heavier than a conventional folding frame
     
     Tilting Wheelchair Frame
     
     The tilting wheelchair frame is similar to the rigid frame but usually larger and the side frames can either be welded to connecting bars or bolted. Kid's tilt chairs are usually bolted to allow for easy growth but adult tilt wheelchairs usually have welded frames for added strength. Tilting frames are, for the most part, made of aluminum. Tilting frame wheelchairs do not have the seat frame incorporated into them and require a completely independent seat frame which is hinged to the rear of the wheelchair frame
     
     Bariatric Wheelchair Frames
     
     The bariatric frame can be folding but will usually be rigid for the heavier duty models and can be made of steel or aluminum depending on the weight capacity the wheelchair is designed for. Bariatric wheelchairs are basically the same as any other wheelchair except the joints are usually reinforced and in the case of folding frames there may be two cross frames instead of the conventional single cross frame.

     Generic supports that have adjustment for angle and height built into their mounting hardware. They are usually available in a tall or standard height and sometimes can be ordered with larger lateral wings. While having lateral supports moulded into it's shape, a contoured solid back's laterals have no adjustability. A limited amount of customization can be done to this back support by opening the back cover and adding foam where needed.
     
     These backs can also be used for creating a "foam in place" back support. Foam in place is a process where two chemicals are poured into a large plastic bag which when mixed together create a chemical reaction that produces foam. This plastic bag is placed inside the cover of the back next to the user's back. As the foam is created it flows through the back support, within the plastic bag, and moulds itself to the shape of the user sitting in the chair. While being a very comfortable and supportive back rest when the user is fitted properly, if the user is not seated exactly the same each time they use the wheelchair this back will not only be uncomfortable but actually create pressure points.

     There are a variety of wheelchair arm rests on the market to meet the needs of various types of wheelchair users. Armrests on wheelchairs have various functions depending on the user's needs but the most common are aids for transferring, comfort while sitting and weight shifting.
     
     Wheelchair users who are able to stand when transferring use the arms for support when sitting or standing and should be strong enough to support their weight. People who slide sideways off the wheelchair to transfer will use the armrest on the opposite side of their transfer to either push themselves off or pull themselves onto the wheelchair seat.
     
     The height of the wheelchair arms should be sufficient to rest the elbows on without forcing the shoulders to either hunch up or sag down for the best comfort for most users.
     
     Weight shifting is done when the user pushes themselves up off the seat of the wheelchair to change their position slightly. Everyone, with a disability or not, will weight shift somehow when sitting for a period of time. This action stimulates blood flow in the buttocks and reduces the chances of developing pressure sores.
     
     While most people want arms on their wheelchairs they are not required and do in fact actually add to the base price of most models of wheelchairs. If the user decides they do not wish to have arms the purchaser can save anywhere from $50.00 to $250.00 on the cost of the wheelchair.

            title: "Wheelchair Footrests",
            definition: """
     There are two or three types of foot support for a wheelchair. The two most common are generally known as "footrests" and "legrests". A footrest consists of a footrest hanger and a footplate for the user's foot to rest on and a legrest has a "calf pad" mounted on an elevating hanger to support the lower leg when elevated and the same options for a footplate as the footrest will have.
     Proper support of the feet and legs is important to the comfort of the wheelchair user and long term use of footrests/legrests that are not set up properly can lead to pain in the lower back and excess pressure on the buttocks or the lower thigh area.
     
     Footrests
     
     Footrests are the most common type of front rigging on a wheelchair and are pretty basic. Footrest for wheelchairs usually are removable and swingaway to the side to make transfers easier. They are equipped with a choice of the styles of footplates available to support the user's feet.
     
     The footrest hangers are usually available in two or three different angles to best meet the user's needs. Kid's wheelchair footrests are often angled at 90° to keep the feet directly below the knees which are positioned at 90° to the thigh. While 90° is the optimum position for everyone, it isn't practical for adults as their lower legs are usually too long to be set at 90°. So adults usually have a choice of 70° or 60° hangers to keep the hangers clear of the swivelling casters and keep the seat height at a reasonable height.
     
     Legrests
     
     Legrests aren't nearly as common as footrests on most wheelchairs but are almost standard equipment on relining and tilting wheelchairs as most users who benefit from tilt and recline will also benefit from elevating legrests. Legrests are pretty heavy so they aren't commonly used on the lightweight wheelchairs.
     
     Legrests have one characteristic that prevents them from being a prefect option for those who need elevation of their feet. It is difficult to set the footplate position to be comfortable in all of the positions they can be set. Because of the position of the user's knee and the physics involved when it is straightened, the footplate adjustment needs to be longer when the leg is extended than when it is bent.
     
     If the footplate is set properly when extended, it will be hitting the floor and too long when lowered. If the footplate is set correctly when the knee is bent, it will be too short when elevated and force the user's knees up into the air and put pressure on the buttocks.
     
     Articulating Legrests
     
     Articulation solves the issue of footplate length when the elevation is changed by changing the distance to the footplate. As the legrest is elevated the footplate distance increases and when lowered the footplate distance is shortened.
     
     While articulating legrests are the best option for those who require legrests, both the standard legrests and the articulating type are still available on many models of wheelchairs.
     
     Fixed Front End Wheelchairs
     
     Sports wheelchairs and rigid wheelchairs that are built for performance and light weight do not normally use footrests or legrests at all. Wheelchairs with a fixed front end normally have an angle adjustable footboard mounted directly to front of the wheelchair frame to support the weight of the legs.
     
     Footplate Options
     
     Standard footplates can be made of aluminum or a plastic composite material and are set about 90° to the downtube of the footrest/legrest hanger. Footplates come in different sizes but generally support from the back of the user's heel to around the ball of the foot.
     
     Angle adjustable footplates are usually aluminum and will have two or three adjustment features depending on the model of wheelchair.
     
     Angle adjustable footplates are generally longer and support more of the foot than standard footplates plus can sometimes be mounted farther forward or backward than the the standard position.
     
     The angle of the plate in relation to the downtube can be adjusted through a large range of angles from almost touching the floor at the toe to almost vertical with the heel almost at the floor as the user requires.
     
     In some case the angle adjustable footplates can also be angled so that the left side of the individual footplate can be higher or lower than the right side of the footplate to accommodate the user.
     
     Footboards are sometimes added to footplates to provide a larger full width platform for the feet to rest on and will be at the same angle as the footplates they are attached to. Footboards are most common on sports chairs that have the foot support built right into the wheelchair and are mounted to the frame rather than a footrest/legrest

            image: "Wheelchair Casters",
            title: "Wheelchair Casters",
            definition: """
     Wheelchair casters come in a variety of diameters and widths and each different style and size will have its own attributes that make it appropriate for different applications. The purpose of wheelchair casters is to stabilize the wheelchair while the drive wheels (powered wheels on a power wheelchair & large handrimmed wheels on a manual wheelchair) propel the wheelchair.
     
     The casters are usually located at the front of the wheelchair but on wheelchairs where the drive wheels are in the center or front of the wheelchair the casters are usually located at the rear of the wheelchair.
     
     Caster Load
     
     Caster load (the weight on the casters) is a factor that affects the ability of the casters to roll over obstacles and the lower the caster load the smaller the casters can be and still function well. Caster load has a greater effect if the casters are located on the front of the wheelchair regardless of whether the wheelchair is electric or manual. Caster loading is a factor that experienced wheelchair technicians take into account when setting up a wheelchair for a user, if possible, try to find an acceptable load level for function.
     
     Caster Diameter
     
     The diameter of wheelchair casters can range from 3" for some rigid sports chairs to 12" for extreme rough terrain wheelchairs with the most common diameters being 6" and 8".
     
     Generally the larger the caster diameter the easier the wheelchair will be propelled over obstacles and rough ground. On the other hand, the smaller the caster diameter the easier the caster will swivel and the more responsive the wheelchair will be when turning.
     
     Based on this, one would think that the little 3" casters would be almost impossible to use outdoors however because the type of wheelchairs that use the tiny casters have their center of gravity centered on the rear wheels and there is very little weight on the casters.
     
     Caster Width
     
     Caster width is another factor that affects how a caster will roll over rough terrain. The wider the caster tire, the easier rough terrain can be travelled over. Most manual wheelchair casters are around ¾" wide with 2" being considered wide and power wheelchair casters can be between 2" and 4" wide.
     
     The heavier the combined weight of the wheelchair and the user, the wider the the casters have to be to prevent them from sinking into soft terrain and to enable the wheelchair to roll over obstacles.
     
     Caster Tires
     
     There are three types of wheelchair tires for casters, air filled, solid and foam filled or flat free inserts. The tires on the casters can be a huge factor on how easily the wheelchair will roll over all terrain. Generally the harder the caster tire, the easier the wheelchair will roll and turn corners. The softer the caster tire, the harder it will be to propel the wheelchair and the harder it will be to turn the wheelchair.
     
     Air tires are not terribly common but they will roll over soft terrain easier the solid tires. Although air tires are available on casters as small as 6" in diameter I never recommended them for tires less than 8" because the smaller the caster, the easier the tire goes soft and the harder it is to refill the air tire.
     
     Solid tires are the best caster tires for those who want a wheelchair to roll and turn as easy as possible but they give the roughest ride over bumps and ridges in the ground surface. The biggest advantage is they are virtually maintenance free and they won't go flat and won't likely wear out in the life of the wheelchair.
     
     Foam filled or flat free inserts are basically air tires that have a semi-solid core. The advantage is they will stay harder than air tires and not be subject to flat tires but still give a bit softer ride than a solid tire. This type of caster tire will wear out over time and have to be replaced on wheelchairs that have heavy use and would be considered a compromise between air filled and solid caster tires.

     The rear wheels on a manual wheelchair come in several different sizes and a couple of different styles as normal options. generally speaking the larger the wheel, the easier propulsion will be and the wider the wheel, the better they will be able to roll over softer terrains such as lawns.
     
     While the wheels have a definite effect on wheelchair propulsion, the tires chosen will ultimately be more important for everyday users. There are several options for tires and each will have its own advantages.
     
     The wheels pictured are all high end wheels that do not come as options for most wheelchairs. If they are wanted, they usually have to be purchased separately as aftermarket products and are designed for sports and high performance wheelchairs. These wheels are ultra light weight, ultra strong wheels, use specialized tires and are more high performance than necessary for the average user.
     
     Composite Mag Wheels
     
     Composite mag wheels are by far the most common wheels in use for wheelchairs today and come standard on most wheelchairs. The composite mags are made out of is a nylon/fibreglass-like material that is strong, resilient and light weight. They can be fitted with several types of tires and handrims to meet the needs of the user.
     
     The rims of these wheels are maintenance free and are designed to spring back to their original shape should outside pressures due to accident or rough use warp of bend them
     
     Spoked Wheels
     
     The spoked wheel is very similar to the spoked wheel on a bicycle and was the norm for all wheelchair prior to the development of composite wheels for wheelchair use. Spoked wheels are still optional on many wheelchair models but only those who expect high performance from their wheelchairs usually opt for them.
     
     In spite of their popularity, composite mag wheels will flex during use and this flexing increases the energy needed to propel the wheelchair. Spoked wheels, when in good condition, do not flex and are there fore more efficient for the user. The average user probably wouldn't notice the difference but those who are very active probably will.
     
     High Performance Wheels
     High performance wheels are the wheels pictured at the top of this article are not used by average wheelchair users. There are many kinds of these wheels on the market for sports and very active users. High performance wheelchairs and products is a large topic and can fill a web site on its own and because it is beyond the scope of this web site I'll not go any further into this topic.

Generally the harder the tire, the easier the wheelchair will roll and turn corners. The softer the tire, the harder it will be to propel the wheelchair.
     
     Air tires are fairly common on the rear of a wheelchair because they will roll over soft terrain easier and give a better ride than solid tires. The disadvantage of air tires is they will go flat if punctured and they will go soft even without any damage eventually. An air tire that is under inflated makes the wheelchair hard to push and causes excessive wear on the tires. Air tires and tubes need to be replaced more often than solid tires.
     
     Solid tires are the best tires for those who want a wheelchair to roll as possible but they give the roughest ride over bumps and ridges in the ground surface. The biggest advantage is they are virtually maintenance free, they won't go flat and they won't likely wear out in the life of the wheelchair. Solid tires are most suitable for wheelchairs that are expected to stay indoors most of the time such as nursing home use.
     
     Foam filled or flat free inserts are basically air tires that have a semi-solid core. The advantage is they will stay harder than air tires and not be subject to flat tires but still give a bit softer ride than a solid tire.

            title: "Wheelchair Handrims",
            definition: """
     The handrims, sometimes known as pushrims, of the wheelchair are the part the wheelchair user grips to propel the wheelchair. Handrims are attached to the wheelchair wheel by a set of bolts and can be removed to narrow the wheelchair for people who don't self-propel their wheelchair. There are several types and and styles of wheelchair hand rim and each have their own benefits and drawbacks.
     
     Chrome Handrims
     Chrome handrims are pretty rare these days but still available on some models. Aluminum, the preferred wheelchair material these days, cannot be chromed and not many manufacturers offer steel chromed handrims because of the weight. You'll still find chrome on institutional wheelchairs but that's about the only place.
     
     Aluminum Anodized Handrims
     Aluminum handrims are by far the most common handrims and are usually standard equipment on many wheelchair models. Because aluminum is a dirty material and will continually shed a fine black dust the manufacturers will have their aluminum handrims anodized to seal them and prevent the oxidization that causes the black dust.
     
     Composite Handrims
     Composite handrims are plastic like handrims that are often found on the lowest priced wheelchairs. There isn't really anything wrong with this type of handrim except the back side facing the wheel is often open and I've had some customers complain that they didn't like them for that reason.
     
     Vinyl Coated Handrims
     Vinyl coated handrims are usually aluminum with a plastic coating applied to the surface to provide a surface that because of friction is much easier to grip than a smooth chrome, aluminum or composite surface. They tend to be a little larger in diameter as well adding to the ease of gripping.
     
     There are a couple of negatives with plastic coated handrims. One is the vinyl can get chipped off over time creating a rough surface and exposing the non-anodized aluminum rim underneath. The second negative is, when a wheelchair user is rolling down a hill or ramp they will usually let the handrim slip along inside their closed hand and apply pressure to the rim to control their speed. Because the vinyl coated handrims use friction to improve the grip of the user a lot of heat is generated when the wheelchair speed is controlled this way.
     
     Foam Covered Handrims
     Foam covered handrims are covered with a thick soft foam that looks similar to pipe insulation. Because the foam is soft and has a bit of friction some users find them quite easy to grip and propel their wheelchair. Over time this foam will chip off like the vinyl coated handrims but because the foam is soft the surface of the handrim is not as rough.
     
     Projection Handrims
     Projection handrims employ about a dozen short (¾" to 2")  nubs, bumps or knobs that extend vertically from the wheelchair handrims. Projection handrims are quite rare and intended for users who are unable to grip the handrim at all. The idea is they will use the palms of their hands to push on the projections and propel the wheelchair that way. Of course some care must be taken when trying to control their speed as in the previous example but for those who need projection handrims they are often the only thing that will work.
     
     Oblique Projection Handrims
     Oblique projection handrims are the same idea as projection handrims but the projections are longer (1" to 3") and they project at about 45° outward from the handrim instead of vertically.
     
     Natural Fit Handrims
     The Natural-Fit is a uniquely designed wheelchair handrim that maximizes the fit between the user’s hand and the rim. The Natural-Fit comes in two pieces: The contoured thumb area and the oval component. It is the combination of these two components that gives the Natural-Fit its unique ability to provide a superior gripping surface, a place to rest your thumb, and dual surfaces for propulsion and braking. Note: This is an aftermarket item and not available from the wheelchair manufacturers.

     Contrary to popular belief, wheel locks on wheelchairs are not brakes. Brakes would be used to slow down and stop a wheelchair but that is not the purpose of wheel locks. Wheel locks are more like parking brakes; designed to keep the wheelchair in place when waiting or transferring in and out of the wheelchair.
     
     Push/Pull to Lock
     These wheel locks are the industry standard on most wheelchairs. They come in either a push to lock version, meaning the user pushes to lock the wheels, or pull to lock, meaning the user pulls to lock the wheels. These wheel locks are located on the top side frame rail in front of each rear wheel.
     
     Scissor Locks
     Scissor lock brakes are chosen on the sportier wheelchairs for very active users. These wheel locks are mounted on the top rail of the side frame of the wheelchair however when not in use are completely under the seat. Very active users who propel their wheelchairs quickly have been known to damage their hands on the push/pull to lock wheel locks because of their close proximity to the wheels. These scissor locks solve this issue by being well out of the way when the wheelchair is being propelled.
     
     Foot Locks
     Foot lock wheel locks are only available on tilt wheelchairs with non-folding frames. Foot locks are not accessible to the wheelchair user and for the use of the caregiver. They are mounted below the back of the seat on the lower side rail bars and each brake is connected to a center brake lever that most people use their foot on.

Drive controls, for the purposes of this web site, are the controls used to actually drive a power wheelchair. The information I've provided here is a quick overview of the most common types of drive controls, and a few of the less common.

With the advances of technology these days there are always people working on new and improved ways to control a wheelchair but probably 98% of all users will be able to find something on this page that will work for them.

The average person would think that there would be nothing easier than driving a power wheelchair by pushing on a little knob in the direction they want to go. While this may be true for the "average person" there are many people who would find this difficult or even impossible because of physical limitations. Because there are so many who can't use a conventional joystick wheelchair manufacturers have devised other ways for people to drive their power wheelchairs.

Proportional Drive Controls

Conventional Joystick

A conventional joystick generally consists of a gimbal knob an on/off switch, a speed control and a battery gauge. Depending on the level of electronics on the wheelchair there may also be program indicators, power indicator lights etc. To use a conventional joystick the user pushes the gimbal in the direction they want to go and the further they push in that direction the faster the wheelchair will move similar to a gas pedal in a car. Pictured is an Invacare PS joystick.

Compact Joystick

When controlled by the chin, the gimbal is mounted on a swingaway mount of some sort and positioned slightly below and forward of the chin. Chin controls work much the same as conventional joysticks in that the user simply pushes the gimbal the direction they want to go and control their speed by the distance they push the gimbal. The knob on the gimbal can be replaced with a small cup or other shaped piece depending on the needs of the user.

Head Control

When set up to be actuated by the head, the gimbal is mounted behind the head and attached to a headrest. The user pushes the left side of the headrest to go left, the right side to go right and pushes back to go forward. In order to back up the user must activate a switch and then push the headrest straight back. The user must activate the switch again to move forward. Normally this is not a serious drawback, but if the user is in a situation where several back and forward movements are needed to get through a doorway or enter an elevator etc., it can be quite annoying.

Finger Control

Finger control drive systems consist of a small square box about 3" x 3" x 1 1/2" with a 2" hole in the top of it. The finger control box can be mounted just about anywhere the user can comfortably reach. To drive the chair with a finger control box, the user places one finger through the hole on the top of the box and moves the finger in the direction they want the power wheelchair to move. This system is basically the same principle as a joystick in that it's a proportional drive but instead of moving a gimbal, the user moves a finger. Pictured as an ASL finger control box.

Touchpad Drive Control

Touch pad drives also drive the power wheelchairs with a finger and can be mounted in several places on the wheelchair depending on the ability of the user to access it. Because touch pads are also proportional, the user can determine and control the speed of the wheelchair while moving simply by a small movement of the finger. The pictured touch pad is a Switch-it

Sip'n'Puff Drive Control

Sip and puff drives are the solution for those users who aren't able to use any part of their body to operate a control device on their power wheelchair. Sip and puff systems are non-proportional drives and require quite a bit of practice by the user to get good at driving. The user will either puff air into a tube or sip on the tube. Not only do the wheelchair electronics distinguish between a sip and a puff, it can also recognize the strength of the sip and puff. A hard sip or puff will mean one thing to the wheelchair and a soft sip or puff will mean something else. The trick for the user is to get used to how hard to sip or puff and be consistent with those actions. Pictured is the ASL Sip N Puff/Head Array packag

            definition: """
     Power wheelchair joysticks are the most common components used to drive the wheelchair and they have to be mounted in a position where the user is able to easily and comfortably access them for extended periods of time. A properly positioned joystick will enable the user to drive their power wheelchair more safely and reduce their fatigue over the day.
     
     A standard joystick mount usually consists of a steel or aluminum rod that is clamped to the wheelchair arm and will adjust forward and back depending on the reach of the user. The standard joystick mount is limited in its ability to be positioned higher and lower, further left or right, or swing out of the way.
     
     The information I've provided below refers to the more common optional mounting devices available to answer some issues with the standard mounts.
     
     Swingaway Joystick Mounts
     
     When approaching a desk or table the joystick, that is normally positioned in front of the armrest, will usually hit the table top and prevent the user from getting in close enough to use the table or desk. A swingaway joystick mount allows for the joystick to be moved out of the way so the user can get close enough to be functional.
     
     The best designed swingaway mounts allow the joystick to be positioned back beside the arm pad instead of in front of the armrest while still pointing forward. The older and less functional swingaway mounts swung the joystick away at a 90° angle to the armrest and pointed it sideways.
     
     If the user wanted to move their wheelchair while the joystick is swung away and they have the older 90° style they have to move the joystick gimbal left and right to go forward and back, and forward and back to go left and right. Needless to say the older style was a hazard when used by anyone who may get confused at times.

     Battery Types
     
     The most common reason for service calls on power wheelchairs and scooters is battery related. Over the years, batteries for mobility devices have improved greatly but they require proper care and maintenance to provide their best performance and longest lifespan.
     
     Originally, all scooter batteries were wet cell batteries which required topping up of the battery acid from time to time and were prone to spilling if tipped over. The life spans of the early batteries were quite short. More recently the batteries have progressed from wet celled, to sealed wet cell (won't leak), to gel cell (lead acid is in gel form instead of liquid and the batteries are sealed). In addition to the changes in types, the quality has greatly improved to provide better performance.
     
     Lithium batteries are the newest evolution of scooter batteries and although expensive can be cost effective over time. The advantages of lithium include 50% less weight, more even power throughout the time between charges and life expectancies of 4 to 10 times longer than lead acid batteries.
     
     Automotive Batteries and Wheelchair batteries are not the same! Although they often look the same and automotive batteries will work, they won't work for long and it's unlikely you'll be allowed to return them. Wheelchair and scooter batteries are designed to give low amounts of power for a long period of time (all day). Automotive batteries are designed to give large amounts of power for a short period of time (minutes).
     
     Battery Charging
     
     Batteries that are overcharged, or undercharged, will not perform as well as they should. The travel range between charges and the lifespan of the batteries will be reduced in either case.
     Your user manual is probably going to tell you to charge your batteries every night if you use your device every day. And if you are in your wheelchair or scooter all day traveling large distances you should absolutely charge your batteries every night.
     If you only use your wheelchair/scooter around home daily and don't go long distances you might be able to get away with charging your batteries once or twice a week. You'll have a battery gauge and I usually tell people to charge their batteries when the gauge is showing half the charge has been used.
     
     Batteries always have an ideal use/charge ratio where they will last the longest. Surprisingly, it's the batteries that are used the most that usually last the longest. If you run down a battery 5% every day and charge it up overnight for a year you may find that you can never get more than 5% of use before you need to charge it and battery life will be diminished. If you run down the battery 60% every day and charge it every night for a year you'll likely get at least 60% of use before having to recharge and the battery life will be longer. This is called battery memory and it's more common in older styles of batteries but can also apply to some degree in the newer styles of batteries.
     
     Battery Chargers
     
     All Scooters and electric wheelchairs are supplied with battery chargers. Because voltages can vary between mobility devices it's imperative that only the charger supplied with the device is used.
     Most chargers will have lights or gauges to indicate the charger is on, working and to let you know when the charging is completed. Should there be a problem with the charging process you should be notified by these lights. Most chargers will not begin charging if the batteries have been charged too much but his is uncommon except in cases where the batteries are in particularly bad condition.
     
     All chargers should be automatic and will stop charging when the batteries are fully charged so it will be safe to leave them charging overnight.
     For specific information about how the charger works for your scooter or electric wheelchair, check your user manual or ask your dealer.
     Battery Storage
     
     For various reasons it may occur that your electric wheelchair or scooter is not going to be used for a long period of time. When not in use your batteries should be charged once a month. This charge keeps them active. If the batteries are not charged for a long period of time they can be either damaged or ruined.
     
     Batteries should be stored in temperatures approaching room temperature give or take 10 degrees. If it's a scooter that won't be used over a winter you can store the scooter in a unheated garage or shed (as long as it will be dry) but the batteries should be brought into a heated area. If the batteries cannot be charged off the scooter then you'll want the scooter indoors too so you're not having to take them out to the scooter every time you need to charge them.
     
     Battery Warranties
     
     Almost all standard batteries for wheelchairs and scooters are warrantied by the battery manufacturer. The standard warranty is 6 months. The average life span of a battery is between 1 and 2 years but I have seen some give up at 6 months and, in rare cases, some have lasted 3, or even 4 years.
     
     Some of the newer scooter and electric wheelchair batteries have specializes batteries that will only fit into specific products. These specialized batteries may be warranted by power wheelchair or scooter manufacturer and have different warranties and terms.
     
     Battery Replacement
     
     Many scooters and wheelchairs have two batteries. If you should check each battery and find that one is not working, but the other is, you'd probably be inclined to just replace the one battery.
     This is false economy as the "good" battery is probably not far from failing itself and pairing it with a new battery will add extra load on the better battery will cause it's lifespan to be shortened. In the end you'll end up replacing both the new and old battery sooner rather than later
