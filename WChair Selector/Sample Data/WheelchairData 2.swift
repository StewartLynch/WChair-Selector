 Standard wheelchairs are the most basic of the categories that self propulsion is an option.
 
 Standard wheelchairs are intended for short term use and although seating systems can be added to the wheelchair this category isn't often chosen for those who will be using a wheelchair on a regular basis.
 
 The advantages of the standard wheelchair is it is sturdy and inexpensive.
 
 The disadvantages are they are heavy, are available in limited sizes, have few options available and no adjustability for comfort or to ease propulsion. The standard wheelchair is the type of wheelchair many department stores and institutions offer as loaner wheelchairs or wheelchair vendors will offer as rental wheelchairs for short term use.
 
 The weight of these wheelchairs make them difficult to use in any terrain other than flat, solid, smooth surfaces. While they can be propelled independently, they are more suited to situations where a caregiver of helper is around to help when needed.
 
 Wheelchair market offers lightweight options, they call them ultra light manual wheelchairs, coming in different sizes and colors, can be adjustable in back seat, arm rest, leg rest.
 
 Manual standard wheelchair can be set with contour back seat , adjustable tension back via velcro straps, specialty back seats to accomodate spinal deformities(kyphosis, lordosis, etc).
 
 Leg/foot rest can be flip up , adjustable in angle for ankle deformities, elevating leg rest are available for manual standrad wheelchair as well.

 These types of wheelchairs are also known as Manual Dynamic Tilt wheelchairs and are most suitable for individuals who require the tilting feature on the seat frame because they are unable to shift their body weight. Type 5 wheelchair models do not fold and feature swing-away footrests, quick release axles for easy servicing and transport, anti-tippers and adjustable-height arms that can be removed. These wheelchair types are highly customizable for individuals with very limited mobility.
 
 The  tilting wheelchairs, the seat-back, seat base, and leg rests tilt back as one unit, somewhat similar to the way a person might tip a four-legged chair backwards to balance it on the back legs. While fully reclining spreads the person's weight over the entire back side of the body, tilting wheelchairs transfer it from only the buttocks and thighs (in the seated position) to partially on the back and head (in the tilted position). Tilting wheelchairs are preferred for people who use molded or contoured seats, who need to maintain a particular posture, who adversely affected by sheer forces (reclining causes the body to slide slightly every time)
 
 Tilt Back feature purpose:
 
 To Improve Posture
 
 Tilting a patient backwards can help defy the effect of the force of gravity which can have a detrimental effect on posture, pushing down on the body and pulling a patient forward. The act of tilting a patient backwards reduces the effect of gravity and helps to maintain a mid line postural position, preventing postural deviation.
 
 To Redistribute Pressure
 
 For a patient who may be at risk of pressure injuries due to sitting in one position for long periods of time, clinicians focused on wound care such as enterostomal nurses, wound care nurses, tissue viability nurses and also occupational therapists, physiotherapists may use tilt in space to reduce their pressure risk.
 
 Tilt in space is an effective method to redistribute pressure off bony prominences such as the sacrum and ITs.  When areas of the body are put under pressure the oxygen levels in cells are reduced due to the mechanical disruption of cell structure and reduced blood flow.  This can lead to cell death and the possibility of pressure injuries occurring.  Increasing blood flow and re-oxygenating the cells of the affected area can be achieved through offloading pressure on the weight bearing area using features such as tilt in space.
 
 By offloading the pressure in this way regularly, (suggested every 1-2 hours for repositioning) then we are effectively reducing the risk of that skin breakdown and therefore the risk of pressure injuries.
 
 To Assist with Reduced Head and Trunk Control
 
 If a client’s muscle strength is reduced as a result of their physical or mental disability or condition, tilt can help reduce the negative effects on their posture, by keeping their spine, head and thoracic region in mid line. This improves positioning and ultimately, comfort.
 
 Reduce Risk of Falls and Sliding from Chairs
 
 Tilting a patient and changing their centre of gravity contributes to better positioning and therefore reduced risk of falls. In my clinical practice, I've found that a tilt position reduces agitation in patients with neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's, which often contributes to falls from chairs.
 
 Assist Corrective Positioning for those with a Kyphotic Posture
 
 For those patients who have a fixed or flexible spinal contracture such as kyphosis, tilt in space can be really beneficial to support their posture.  They may be ‘hunched’ over with limited or no ability to make eye contact with others, due to the position of their spine, then once they are tilted back, their head neck and shoulders are supported, and their visual field improves.  This leads to better social inclusion, interaction, communication and increased function.
 
 To Improve Physiological Processes
 
 By sitting upright as opposed to slumping or in a deviated postural position, the patients' ability to breathe is greatly improved, reducing the risk of respiratory infections.  Likewise, other essential bodily functions such as swallowing, digestion and elimination are also improved as a result of this upright positioning.
 
 Easier Repositioning by Individual / Carer
 
 For a person at risk of pressure injuries, who requires constant repositioning, (every 2 hours) a tilt in space chair takes the work out of this task, making it easy and fast to complete by the carer in a swift, controlled motion, or by the patient if they can control their own tile via a powered handset.
 
 Which Angle of Tilt is Right for  Patient?
 
 15°-30°of tilt ,  research shows that this range of angles can improve positioning, reduce sliding and contribute to increased functional ability.
 
 30°- 45° of tilt ,  larger degrees of tilt are often needed for those at risk of pressure injuries. Evidence shows that the optimum angle for an effective weight shift and therefore pressure management is between 30° and 45°.

 Broda is a wheelchair company that traditionally offers tilt-in-space positioning chairs with the Comfort Tension Seating® system which prevents skin breakdown through reducing heat and moisture for people in any type of healthcare setting, but commonly used in long term care/skilled nursing facilities or home care.
 
 When someone is confined to a chair all day long, fidgeting is inevitable. They are designed to accommodate involuntary movements. Additionally, the design of seating allows the chair to conform to the body, fitting it to the individual who will use it most. If someone can comfortably sit in a chair all day, his or her risk of falling decrease. By making comfort features a priority, you also increase the wheelchair safety of users. Here are three key features of Broda’s chairs that help to achieve both goals:
 
 Tilt-in-Space: Tilt-in-space wheelchairs allow people to use their upper extremities more easily — giving them increased independence and boosting their quality of life. It also provides them with greater postural support by aligning their hips at a fixed angle. Proper posture is important for reducing pain and decreasing the risk of additional health problems. The ability to tilt decreases weight and tension on the upper body, making daily activities like eating and communicating easier.
 
 Dynamic Seating: Those who are in long-term care may find it increasingly difficult to move purposefully. They need seating that accommodates their fluctuating muscle tone and reflexes, and Broda’s Comfort Tension Seating meets that need. It’s integrated into a durable frames to accommodate people who are prone to agitation. This type of seating is perfect for patients who have conditions like ALS, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, or MS and struggle with tremors or involuntary movements. Combined with tilt-in-space positioning, Comfort Tension Seating drives better clinical outcomes and quality of life.
 
 Pressure Redistribution: Comfort Tension Seating is designed to contour to the individual, distributing the weight of the patient across multiple points. It’s vital for comfort as well as for preventing pressure injuries.
 
 Functionality
 
 They help users achieve adequate posture. In turn, this supports the respiratory system and helps facilitate digestion while reducing the risk of aspiration and other GI tract implications.
 
 Broda’s chairs give patients the ability to tilt and recline, which means caretakers no longer have to move patients every couple of hours to ensure proper blood flow. Wheelchair users can enjoy more freedom without unwanted disruptions to shift position. With additional features like the adjustable footrests that make it easy to transfer patients in and out of their chairs, both quality of care and quality of life increase.
 
 If a patient requires frequent repositioning due to excessive swelling or edema, they’re almost certain to become quite uncomfortable in a standard wheelchair. Research also shows that spinal pain is common among wheelchair users. In that case, they may choose to lie down in bed more frequently. Instead of being more mobile, they end up confined to one room — and that isolation can take a toll on their mental health. As many as 1 in 4 palliative care patients experience depression. No one should be confined to a single room for a majority of their days, but not all wheelchair styles are functional enough to avoid this reality.
 
 Because Broda’s chairs are designed with functional mobility features in mind, patients can sit for much longer periods.

 A motorized wheelchair, powerchair, electric wheelchair or electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) is a wheelchair that is propelled by means of an electric motor (usually using differential steering) rather than manual power. Motorized wheelchairs are useful for those unable to propel a manual wheelchair or who may need to use a wheelchair for distances or over terrain which would be fatiguing in a manual wheelchair. They may also be used not just by people with 'traditional' mobility impairments, but also by people with cardiovascular and fatigue-based conditions.
 
 Battery
 
 The electric motors of powerchairs are usually powered by 12 to 80 ampere hour 12 volt rechargeable deep-cycle batteries, the smaller batteries are used in pairs to give the chair enough power to last at least one day between charges. These are available in wet or dry options. As wet-cell batteries may not legally be carried on an aircraft without removing them from the wheelchair and securing them in a shipping container, dry-cell batteries are preferred for powerchair use. Many powerchairs carry an on-board charger which can be plugged into a standard wall outlet; older or more portable models may have a separate charger unit.
 
 Controller
 
 A typical joystick controller
 
 Controllers are most commonly an arm-rest mounted joystick which may have additional controls to allow the user to tailor sensitivity or access multiple control modes. The controller may be swing-away to aid in side-transfers. For users who are unable to use a hand controller various alternatives are available such as sip-and-puff controllers, worked by blowing into a sensor. In some cases the controller may be mounted for use by an aide walking behind the chair rather than by the user. Capabilities include turning one drivewheel forward while the other goes backward, thus turning the wheelchair within its own length (differential steering).
 
 Mind-controlled wheelchairs, actually working by the detection of brainwaves or nerve signals via sensors on the scalp or elsewhere, has been demonstrated in the laboratory environment.
 
 Seat
 
 The seating on a powerchair can vary in design. Starting with a basic sling seat and backrest made of vinyl or nylon, some chairs have an optional padding, some have more comfortable cushion and backrest options which may include a head rest. There are companies which can fit their own backrests and seat cushions for people with increased need for stability in the trunk, or at increased risk of pressure sores from sitting out. Finally, specialist seating solutions are available for users who need individually tailored support. Leg rests may be integrated into the seating design and may have powered adjustment for those users who need to vary their leg position. Powerchairs may also have a tilt-in-space, or reclining facility for users who are unable to maintain an upright seating position indefinitely. This function can also help with comfort by shifting pressure to different areas for a while, or with positioning in a wheelchair when a user needs to be hoisted in.

 Clinically Researched To Help Prevent Pressure Injuries And Falls
 
 The Seating Matters chairs have been carefully designed and researched intensively to help provide safe and effective seating for people in nursing homes, hospitals and those with complex seating needs. We’re passionate about providing chairs that are effective in preventing pressure injuries, falls and contractures.

 Seating Matters collaborated with leading researchers at Ulster University on a KTP Research Project* to identify the importance of suitable seating provision in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers and postural difficulties.  This randomised control trial explored the effectiveness of specialist seating provision within a nursing home environment and how it has the potential to impact positively on the health and wellbeing of residents and their caregivers. It identified the key principles of correct positioning, seating and mobility and the influence this can have on the health of older people.
 
 Clinical Outcomes

 The significant results* have demonstrated what we already believe, that the correct use of clinical, therapeutic seating can lead to:

     Pressure injury reduction.
     Improved posture and function.
     Reduced sliding and falling from chairs.
     Reduced time spent in bed.
     Improved comfort and quality of life.
     Reduced expenditure on staff and resources.


 Pressure Management

 Many people who suffer from long term disabilities, who are elderly or lack mobility often spend long periods of time sitting. When people spend prolonged time sitting, they can become very uncomfortable and may develop poor posture, pressure injuries or both.

 Many chairs do not incorporate necessary features for pressure management in seating. These include being able to adjust to a person’s individual size, provide postural support, repositioning for weight redistribution and appropriate cushion use.

 Seating Matters chairs have been designed to provide high levels of pressure management through key features.

 Pressure Management is comprised of visco-elastic memory foam combined with Dartex multi-stretch breathable fabric. These materials have been successfully clinically trialed and facilitate safe immersion and envelopment of body prominences which is vital in pressure redistribution.

 Not only does the Seating Matters range provide high levels of pressure care, by using its separate tilt in space, recline and elevating leg rest, these movements alone help provide a clinically effective weight shift for pressure care without the need for transferring the resident from the chair.

 
 Postural Management

 Failure to address postural management can increase the risk of pressure injuries and harmful secondary complications like fixed contractures, respiratory infections, pain and reduced quality of life.

 Supporting optimal sitting posture can improve independence, comfort, communication and interaction as well as physiological functioning. This can be supported by features such as tilt in space, back angle recline, adjustable seat dimensions as well as positioning accessories like lateral supports.
 
 Mobility

 Certain features of the Seating Matters chairs make mobility and transfers much easier for both the patient and caregiver.

 A push handle and swivel castors facilitate ease of movement around the home or care facility.

 Other features may include:

     Removable arms which facilitate side transfer onto the bed, toilet or wheelchair.
     Forward tilt which makes transfers easier to and from the chair allowing the person to stand independently or with the assistance of a standing aid.
     Patient lift accessibility; the design of the chair frame allows the hoist to glide below the chair when hoisting the patient in or out.
 
 
 Adjustable And Customisable For All Different Heights And Sizes

 We are all different shapes, sizes and dimensions and accommodating this in seating is fundamental to comfort, pressure management and posture.

 Seating should be adjusted to suit an individual’s dimensions and position of their joints. This should take into consideration the individual’s seat width, seat height, seat depth, arm height and back height as well as the angles within the chair.

 These features can all be adjusted within the Seating Matters chairs and as there is no velcro in the design, it passes very stringent infection control standards and makes re-issue and re-use of the chair very simple.
 
 
 Enhancing Quality Of Life

 “Each day I realise more and more the impact of seating on peoples lives. For these people, the quality of their chair determines the quality of their life.”

 Martina Tierney, Occupational Therapist & Clinical Director at Seating Matters.

 Martina truly understands that seating has a dramatic impact on peoples’ lives, especially for those who sit for prolonged periods of time.

 Too many people continue to endure constant pain and suffering because of poor posture and a reduced quality of life from completely avoidable pressure ulcers.  Proper seating can solve these problems and that is why getting the right chair for the right person is so important.

 At Seating Matters the patient is at the heart of every decision and we have created a culture of continuous improvement, meaning that our products and services are continually enhanced to provide the best service and help as many people in need around the world as possible.

 As the Seating Matters range is backed by its high quality manufacturing and clinical research and being clinically proven to prevent pressure injuries and falls, why don’t you give those in need the gift of comfort, mobility and safety whilst greatly improving and enhancing their quality of life.
 
 
 The Milano provides dignity, pressure care and comfort for people with limited mobility. The Milano has been designed specifically for care facilities to address pressure management, falls prevention, infection control, maintenance of mobility and safe manual handling.

 The Milano fits people of all of shapes and sizes through its adjustable seat width, seat depth and foot plate height.

 The Milano has high levels of pressure care and has separate tilt in space, recline and an elevating leg rest. These movements provide a clinically effective weight shift for pressure care without transferring the resident from the chair.

 The chair is unique as it caters to residents of all mobility levels and transfer methods. This means a person can use the Milano when they can stand independently and continue to do so if they progress to needing a stand up lifter or a full hoist. Many other available chairs do not allow for this option and inhibit a person’s mobility as it declines.

 As the Milano provides postural support and pressure care, it enables a person with fluctuating mobility to transfer with assistance when they are able, or the option to transfer using a lifter when they are unwell or fatigued.

 For infection control, we’ve used healthcare grade fabrics that are hard wearing, easily cleaned and suitable for delicate skin. The cushions are completely removable so all areas can be easily cleaned and there is no velcro.

 The Milano is lightweight and easy to operate. Directional castors and smart design means smaller carers can easily move the chair along hallways and in tight spaces.

 The Milano is available in electric or manual operation. The electric version allows the user or carer to operate tilt, recline and leg rest functions using a remote control. The manual version allows the carer to operate tilt, recline and leg rest functions using the smooth and easy gas struts.
 
 Features

 The Milano has:

 Tilt in space to allow for re-positioning for pressure care and comfort of the user. Elevating leg rest and recline are also standard.

 Dartex multi stretch pressure management materials throughout all patient contact surfaces. This material is breathable with moisture permeability to ensure that the surface remains dry and comfortable for the user. This material can be wiped down for infection control and hygiene requirements.

 Medium to high pressure management cushion, using memory foam. This cushion is removable for cleaning and if you wish to use a different type. An advantage of our memory foam cushions is they do not require maintenance or adjustment for each person, unlike a gel or air cushion. The cushion is also easily replaceable.

 Adjustable seat width, foot plate height and seat depth allows the chair to fit the size and requirements of the user.

 A light weight frame with directional castors to allow the chair to be easily pushed in a straight line or moved throughout a small room.
